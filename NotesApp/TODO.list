TODO list:

1. No ontextchanged listener for com.mohamedrejeb.richeditor.ui.material3.RichTextEditor

Need to modify sources

2. Add html to pdf export feature

- Need to use WebView or native canvas drawing. No other approaches so far.

3. Revisit Proguard configs and update project to use Dagger for multi-module.
Looks like we need additional configs.
